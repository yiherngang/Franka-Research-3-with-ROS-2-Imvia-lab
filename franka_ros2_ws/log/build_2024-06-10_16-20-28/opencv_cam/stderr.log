[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcamera_calibration_parsers.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "camera_calibration_parsers", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_calibration_parsers" with any of the following names:

    camera_calibration_parsersConfig.cmake
    camera_calibration_parsers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_calibration_parsers" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "camera_calibration_parsers_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "camera_calibration_parsers"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
